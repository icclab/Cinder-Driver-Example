Cinder Driver Example
===

This is simply an example of how a Cinder driver might look like. This skeleton
of a driver can be used as a basis to build your own storage driver for Cinder.
This FooDriver can also be integrated into Cinder how it is. All it does is
output messages on the log whenever it's called. This confirms that the driver
is running correctly.
